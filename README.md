# Chess
Chess made in Python using pygame.

Quite unoptimized, if I were to make it again I would instead generate and save all legal moves

## Steps to play
1. Download Python and install pygame
2. Download source code
3. Run src/scripts/main.py
4. Drag and click pieces to move them

## TODO
- Completely rewrite logic of Move.py
- Make website to play
- Add tests
- Add click to move
